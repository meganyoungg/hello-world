I am 25 years old, played competitive soccer my entire life which led me to D1 soccer in college. I have had 4 knee surgeries, which unfortunately, has led me to not be able to play highly anymore. I love video games (mainly fps), snowboarding, hiking, traveling, learning more and playing with my cats + dog. I studied bioengineering in college and fell in love with data science after I graduated. I am currently a data analyst and am so excited to learn more about this incredible field within this program.
